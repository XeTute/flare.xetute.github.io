            <h1>Hello, Friend.</h1>
            <h3>That's a simple overview on how to use Flare.</h3>
            <p>Flare is a webapp which allows you to chat with different Characters. 
               You can select Characters trough the "Characters" tab (click the three lines at top, right). Simply click on a name to start a chat. 
               Don't be shy: You have to send the first message. 
               If you want your character to be display on the list, you can request one trough the "Request Persona" button. 
               This will open up a Email window, where you can specify the characters name(3 - 20 letters), a brief (12 - 50 letters) description and a persona(35 - 750 letters). 
               If we add your persona to our collection, we'll always make sure to email you back! Thanks for any characters in advance.
            </p>
            <p>If you've already started a chat, you can simply go to the "Chats" tab. 
               You will see all of your recent chats there. To delete a chat, simply click the "X" next to the chat name. This won't show any warning.</p>
            <p>Using the "Profile" tab, you can also edit what every Character knows about you. 
               If you want the Character to know something about you, simply click "Update Persona" and a textfield will appear. 
               Tell every Characters what it needs to know about you! You can alse edit your username on there. (Note, usernames are saved on your device. If you sign in on a new device, you'll have to set it again.)
            </p>
